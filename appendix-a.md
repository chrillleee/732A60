# Questions and Answers 

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| What tools do you use when performing a literature search? | Research rabbit, Sci space, Chat with pdf, Elicit, ChatGPT | 
| In what way has AI changed your workflow? | It saves a lot of time by helping you find relevant papers in the same field and summarizing them, allowing you to focus on the most interesting ones.  |
| If you use a tool like Consensus, how does it summarize your research? | It summarizes it quite good, and overall it is correct. However the first reference in this particular instance was a low impact paper, which is not ideal.   |
| What are your thoughts on the more traditional methods like Google scholar? | Google scholar is not really replaceable, people are used to it. Everyone is using it for something. For example when I want to look up researchers, see their work, and who they are collaborating with google scholar is superb. Not sure that the other tools can do that. Also it is fast. |
