# Introduction 
The purpose of this seminar was to get an overview of the Statistics and Machine Learning programme.

# Key Findings
## Overview of the program
The Statistics and Machine Learning programme aims on gaining the knowledge for building advanced models to explain complex systems and predict events. It focuses on using advanced software to analyze large data sets and extract valuable insights. Additionally, it highlights gaining in-depth knowledge of statistical and machine learning methods.

The program is 120 ECTS credits, and the first year 60 credits consists of only mandatory courses. The second year have 30 elective courses and ends with a crescendo that is the master thesis. 

Mandetory Courses: 
- Advanced Academic studies
- Statistical Methods
- Machine Learning
- Advanced R programming
- Introduction to Python
- Computational statistics
- Advanced Data Mining
- Deep Learning
- Bayesian learning
- Big Data Analytics

You need to pass the this course in Advanced Academic Studies in order to get access to the courses in the second semester of the programme. There are also requirements to obtain the third semesters course catalogue. There is also a third requirement, which i assume is the threshold for the master thesis.  
Registration is done in Lisam and schedules are accessed via TimeEdit.

## Overview of 732A60
There are a total of 7 seminars and all are mandatory, and the seminars consists of "roundtable discussions" on the provided topics. There is also a project work that will be a paper written on a specific topic.

## Research Seminars
During the autumn there are some additional seminars where people from aboard or nationally presents different topics in the following fields: 
- Statistics and Mathematical Statistics
- IDA Machine Learning Seminars
## Job opportunities
Currently there are many job opportunities in the field of Machine learning, and in the slides it highlights som industries and companies that have needs for Machine learning, and for which positions you potentially can apply for e.g. data analyst, data scientist, engineer, manager or consultant.  

## Plagiarism 
Plagiarism is prohibited and all suspected incidents will be reported to the disciplinary board. 
Collaboration is allowed between groups but the solutions shall not be shared, because it "Destroys a normal learning process for the students"  and "Might lead to intentional/unintentional plagiarism". All students should contribute equally. 

## People
All Personnel from the Division of Statistics and Machine Learning were provided and Questions related to the program one should contact Bertil Wegmann.

# Conclusion 
This seminar provided an introduction to the Statistics and Machine Learning program, expectations, objectives, and opportunities. The seminar highlighted what is expected of the student and a code of conduct related to plagiarism.
