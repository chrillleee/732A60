# 1 Introduction 
The purpose of Seminar 7 is to provide guidelines on how to write a paper and what to consider in your argumentation. 

# 2 Key Findings
## 2.1 To think about 
When writing a paper there are some general things to consider. Explain concepts before using them. Always write the full term or phrase first, followed by its abbreviation and acronyms. Grammar should be consistent throughout the paper, with appropriate use of tense. Paraphrasing is a form of plagiarism, so it is essential to properly attribute sources. When writing equations, all notations shall be defined and consistency is key.
## 2.1 Writing summaries
Summaries are important to understand the point of the paper without the need to read the entire document. The summary should provide a brief account of the most relevant points, with minimal background. It should explain the document's relevance and value, capturing the main messages including the purpose of the report, methods used, and the significance of the results. It should assess whether the research question was answered and highlight the novelty of the research. Additionally, any contradictions with existing research should be noted.
## 2.1 What to write about?
The significance and contribution of the research can be assessed by evaluating the relevance of the research questions and the extent to which the aims are achieved in the paper. The text's contribution to new knowledge should be considered, as well as how it compares to other works in the field.

The methodology should be clearly explained, considering whether other studies are referenced and how objective or biased the approach is. The validity and reliability of the results, including whether qualitative or statistical tests were used, should be assessed. It's important to consider if there are better or alternative approaches and if the limitations and directions for future research are discussed.

The argument and use of evidence should be evaluated for clarity in the problem statement or hypothesis. The consistency of the arguments are important, and conclusions should be balanced. This includes assessing the validity of the data. The evidence effectiveness in supporting the argument should be considered, especially whether the simulations truly back the claims. Finally, conclusions should be justified and directly based on the results.
## 2.1 Critical reviews
A critical review involves analyzing and evaluating someone else's work, presenting a supported point of view. There are different types of reviews, such as reviewing a manuscript like opposing a master’s thesis, reviewing a paper as part of your own research with an emphasis on methodological issues. When writing a review, the main guideline is to provide constructive criticism. Use cautious language and highlight positive features first. Similarly, one can point out areas for enhancement. Key questions to consider when writing a review include: 
- What was the article or paper about? 
- How was it written?

When formatting, one should start with a relevant and engaging title. Ensure the abstract provides a clear summary of the paper. The information should be organized into the appropriate sections, and tables and graphs must be well-formatted with captions. Text and visuals should complement each other without unnecessary repetition. Additionally, the methods section should be clearly explained.

When presenting a point of view, ensure that statements are well-supported with clear explanations. It’s important to cite relevant and accurate papers to back claims and provide credibility to the arguments.

# 3 Conclusion 
When writing a paper, it's important to explain concepts clearly before using them and maintain consistency in grammar and tense. Summaries should briefly capture the main points, significance, and methods of the paper, noting the novelty and any contradictions with existing research. The significance of the research can be assessed by evaluating the research questions, methodology, and how the findings contribute to the field. A critical review involves analyzing someone else's work, providing constructive criticism, and ensuring that the paper's points are well-supported by valid evidence and clear explanations. Proper formatting, including clear titles, organized sections, well-labeled visuals, and defined methods, is essential for clarity and readability.
